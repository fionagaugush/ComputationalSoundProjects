      This is an almost minimal command-based live coding engine. Press the
      button to re-evaluate your code. This language allows you to specify a
      rhythmic pattern of beats by entering a space-separated list of times and
      pitches. You can also include javascript computation in the values.
    </p>

    <p>
      To play 2 notes at the same time please denote it in the following manner
      2@220&330 (this plays pitch 220 and 330 together)
    </p>
    <p>As an example:</p>
    <p>1+1@220 2@220*2 1*3@270</p>
